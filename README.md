Hackerrank In a String
Time Complexity: O(n). n is the length of the string ‘s’. This is because the program iterates through the string exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(1) and it is constant. The program uses a fixed amount of additional memory to only store a few variables. In this case, the space does not depend on the size of the input.

Mini-Max Sum
Time Complexity: O(n log n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the list.
Space Complexity: O(n). where n is the size of arr.
